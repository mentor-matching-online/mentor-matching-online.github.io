You should have [collected]({% link _guides/7-2--open-registrations.md %}) and [validated]( {% link _guides/9-1--validate-the-registration-data.md %}) you participant data, and – if you've decided to – [established a baseline for your evaluation]({% link _guides/10-0--evaluate-the-programme.md %}). Now you can match mentors and mentees. You can do this manually or using our software package; this section will focus on using our software package.

The guides in this section:

- explain how to format your data so that our software can use it to match participants
- how to install and run the software on your local device

> At the moment, you need to be able to install software on your device to use our mentor matching software. We are currently working to put our matching software online so you can use it through a web browser from any device. This may come at a small cost. We will update our guidance documents to tell you how to use the software when it is available.
