You will have already [designed your programme evaluation]({% link _guides/3-0--design-your-programme-evaluation.md %}) and possibly [established a baseline to compare against]({% link _guides/10-0--evaluate-the-programme.md %}).

If your evaluation design includes pre- and post- intervention evaluation methods, this is a good moment to establish whether the initial intervention[^part-1] as part of your programme has been effective. 

[^part-1]: If you are following the same format as our case study – a two-part programme, with speed mentoring followed by long-term mentoring – the "initial intervention" is the speed mentoring part of your programme.

The evaluation you do at this point can be compared against the baseline you have already established to see if your participants' awareness, skills or understanding has changed. 

The earlier guide on [creating pre- and post- intervention surveys]({% link _guides/3-2--create-pre-and-post-intervention-surveys.md %}) explains areas you could to evaluate.
