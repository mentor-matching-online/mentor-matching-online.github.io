Jonathan is a cross-government drifter and proud member of OneTeamGov. He has worked across most of the big departments, and spent some time in the private sector. 

He is a software engineer by trade. Jonathan created software that improved the way that the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme was delivered in its second year, reducing the time it takes to match mentors to mentees from 3 days down to a matter of minutes.
