> This guidance only applies if you are running live events. If you have pre-recorded your induction, skip this section.

Depending on the structure of your induction events and any materials you used, you might want to publish your induction materials. For example, if you used slides, you could publish the slides along with the speaker notes. 

Publishing the induction materials can be helpful for participants who were unable to attend a time-specific event. 

You may feel that publishing induction materials is not necessary, especially where this duplicates information already in the existing guidance.

> ## Case study
> ### Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme
> 
> During the induction sessions for the first round of the programme, participants requested copies of the slides used. Instead of publishing the slides, participants were advised to read the written guidance that had already been published, as this contained more explicit and detailed information.
