All mentoring programmes are different. They vary in size, purpose, audience, frequency, and structure. 

Before you start to develop the detailed elements of your programme you should consider things like:

- What evidence do you have to support your programme design?
- Who will be eligible for your programme?
- What kind of relationship are you trying to create between participants?
- How long will the programme run for?
- How often will you run the programme?

The guides in this section will provide advice on each of these programme design questions.
