You are likely to need to use some specialised software tools to deliver each stage of your mentoring programme. 

## Costs 

You may be able to rely on free-to-use digital services, or in-house solutions – particularly for small programmes. You might need to pay for additional software for larger programmes. Many popular software providers provide a limited amount of free of charge use before charging for larger use.

We provide an open-source piece of software to assist with matching mentors and mentees. You can use this software free of charge.

## Data protection

You will need to make your own assessment of the data protection risks involved with using any third-party software as part of your programme. You will also need to consider whether you have a legal basis to collect and process the data using these tools. These considerations will feed into the [data and privacy policy]({% link _guides/6-2--create-a-data-and-privacy-policy.md %}) for your programme.

## Tools you will need

### Registration forms

### Matching software

[Our software]({% link _guides/11-0--match-mentors-to-mentees.md %}) can help with the most complex and time-intensive part of your mentoring programme: the matching process. This software is provided free-of-charge under an open source license and you can run the software locally on your own device.

{:.warning-text}
> At the moment, you need to be able to install software on your device to use our mentor matching software. We are currently working to put our matching software online so you can use it through a web browser from any device. We will update our guidance documents to tell you how to use the software when it is available.

You do not have to use our software if you don't want to, but it can save significant time and money. It takes minutes to match hundreds of participants using our software; the equivalent task could take a person up to a week of full time manual work.
