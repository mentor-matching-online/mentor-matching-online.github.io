In addition to your [general guidance to all participants]({% link _guides/6-1--create-general-guidance.md %}), you may want to create additional guidance specifically for mentees on your programme. 

## What you could include

### What mentees are and what they expected to do

You could use a guidance document to explain to potential participants what a mentee is, and what 'good' participation in the programme looks like if you are a mentee. You could also use this as an opportunity to explain the benefits of having a mentee.

### How the programme will work for mentees specifically

Building on the general guidance to all participants, you could explain in more detail how your programme will work specifically from the perspective of a mentee. 

What you expect them to do will depend on how you structure your programme. Our guidance assumes you are running a two-stage programme, with speed mentoring followed by long-term mentoring. If you are following this process, your guidance could explain:

- the mentee's role in scheduling their speed mentoring session
- the mentee's role in preparing for their speed mentoring session
- how to conduct a speed mentoring session
- what a mentee should do after the speed mentoring session

### Resources to support mentoring conversations

You could also include specific resources from inside your organisation or from other, outside organisations for use in a mentoring session.

### Signposting to a code of conduct

You could signpost mentees to a [code of conduct]({% link _guides/6-4--create-a-code-of-conduct.md %}) that governs how they will be expected to behave and interact with their mentors on the programme.
