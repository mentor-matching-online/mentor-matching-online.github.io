## Use a form or survey tool

We recommend using a form or survey tool to support your registration process. This will make it easy for you to gather data, minimising manual work like copy-and-pasting data, and minimising the risk of invalid or unhelpful data being collected. 

As we advised in our guidance on [tools you'll need to run a programme]({% link _guides/4-0--select-your-tools.md %}), tools like Microsoft Forms or Google Forms are usually a straight-forward choice; especially if you already have access to them in your organisation.

## Participant data to collect

You will need to collect data from both mentors and mentees to enable your matching process. 

Much of information requested below is required to enable [our matching software]({% link _guides/11-0--match-mentors-to-mentees.md %}) to work. In addition to the required information, you could collect additional data that can support your programme more widely. Any non-mandatory data you collect will not be actively used as part of the matching software's algorithm, but it can be used to generate more rich outputs.

Whilst you can collect this information in any way, the data will eventually need to be provided to the software in a standardised file format with specific column headings. [Learn more about the required data formats]({% link _guides/11-0--match-mentors-to-mentees.md %}).

> This Google Form contains a template example you could use to collect your participant data. It is linked to a Google Sheet document that outputs the data in the format required by our matching software. You can freely re-use and adapt this form and spreadsheet to suit your needs.



## Make sure you have a data and privacy policy

Before you start collecting or processing any user data, make sure you have a [data and privacy policy]({% link _guides/5-2--create-a-data-and-privacy-policy.md %}) in place. The next step in our guidance covers this topic.
