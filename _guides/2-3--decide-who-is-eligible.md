Completing a [review of your evidence base]({% link _guides/2-1--review-your-existing-evidence.md %}) means you can take an informed decision about who is able to participate in your programme.

You should consider:

- who is eligible to participate as a mentee
- who is eligible to participate as a mentor

You should do this in parallel with deciding [what type of programme you want to run]( {% link _guides/2-2--decide-the-type-of-programme.md %}). 

## Considerations for mentees

Mentees will be the primary beneficiaries of your programme.

## Considerations for mentors

Mentors are the benefactors of your programme. They are volunteering a potentially significant amount of their own time to support mentees on your programme. 

When deciding what kinds of mentors you want on your programme, you will need to consider:

### How many mentors do you need?

Are there are enough mentors to draw from?
- the prospective mentors are likely to have the skills and expertise to undertake their role
- the prospective mentors are likely to have the time to properly support mentees

### 
You will also need to consider the relative seniority of your mentors compared to your mentees. 

> ## Case study
> ### Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme
> 
> In order to take part in the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme, mentors and mentees had to both:
> 
> 1. be a civil servant employed directly by a central government department or agency
> 2. have a minority sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or variations in sex characteristics
> 
> Participants could not:
> 
> - be employed in the wider public sector, such as local government or the NHS
> - be a consultant, interim contract, or agency-worker
> - be straight and cisgender
> 
> The programme was only open to employees in the Civil Service to ensure that mentors and mentees could discuss issues openly, and to avoid conflicts with any HR policies in relation to contractor staff.
> 
> The programme was intentionally limited to LGBT+ staff. "Allies" were not able to register as a mentor or mentee. The programme made this decision of [the evidence base that identified](/guide/2-1-review-your-existing-evidence/#case-study): it was intended to not only provide a development opportunity but also to increase the visibility of senior LGBT+ staff.
