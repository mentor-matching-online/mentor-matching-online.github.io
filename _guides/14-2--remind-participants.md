You will have [notified your participants of their matches](% link _guides/12-1--notify-participants.md %), and [prompted them to undertake speed mentoring]({% link _guides/12-2--tell-participants-what-to-do-for-speed-mentoring.md %}) and [select a long-term mentor]({% link _guides/14-1--tell-participants-what-to-do-for-long-term-mentoring.md %}). 

You could, additionally, send a reminder email a few days or weeks later, to prompt mentees to select a long-term mentor. This might be helpful because participants might not have seen the original email, they might have misplaced it, or might have simply forgotten to do so.

You could use a slightly adapted version of your earlier emails as a prompt.
