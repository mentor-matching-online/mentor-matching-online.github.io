You will have already [designed your programme evaluation]({% link _guides/3-0--design-your-programme-evaluation.md %}). This will have included a consideration of whether, when and how to gather feedback.

If your evaluation design includes pre- and post- intervention evaluation methods, this is a good moment to establish a baseline of your participants' awareness, skills or understanding. You can use this baseline to compare against later in the programme.

The earlier guide on [creating pre- and post- intervention surveys]({% link _guides/3-2--create-pre-and-post-intervention-surveys.md %}) explains areas you could to evaluate.
