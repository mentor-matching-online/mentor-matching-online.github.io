## When to run sessions

You could choose to run sessions either:

- during your registration window
- after registrations have closed

You're likely to need to run the sessions more than once if you have a relatively large programme.

The advantage to running sessions whilst registrations are open is that you might get people joining the sessions that are considering taking part, but haven't decided yet.

## Publicise the sessions as early as possible

Regardless of your approach, schedule and publicise your induction sessions as early as possible. This means more of your participants will be likely to make time to attend.

If you know your dates in advance of your registration window for your programme opening, you could get participants to sign up for your induction sessions when they join the programme.
