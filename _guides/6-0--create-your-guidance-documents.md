You should have now:

- [designed how your programme will work]({% link _guides/2-0--design-your-programme.md %}), including who is eligible and how they will be matched
- [decided how you will evaluate your programme]({% link _guides/3-0--design-your-programme-evaluation.md %}) to understand if it works and is achieving your objectives
- [picked the tools]({% link _guides/4-0--select-your-tools.md %}) you will use to deliver your programme

This should enable you to write the guidance and prepare your induction materials. 

The guides in the rest of this section will help you to create:

1. guidance materials for mentees and mentors
2. a code of conduct for participants
3. a short induction event for participants

Examples of each are provided for you to adapt, if you don't want to create your own from scratch.
