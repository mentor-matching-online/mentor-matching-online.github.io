You should have now:

- [designed how your programme will work]({% link _guides/2-0--design-your-programme.md %}), including who is eligible and how they will be matched
- [decided how you will evaluate your programme]({% link _guides/3-0--design-your-programme-evaluation.md %}) to understand if it works and is achieving your objectives
- [picked the tools]({% link _guides/4-0--select-your-tools.md %}) you will use to deliver your programme
- [created your registration process]({% link _guides/5-0--create-your-registration-process.md %})

This should enable you to write the guidance and prepare your induction materials. 

The guides in the rest of this section will help you to create:

1. general guidance about your programme
2. tailored guidance materials for mentees and mentors
3. a code of conduct for participants
4. a short induction event for participants

Examples of each are provided for you to adapt, if you don't want to create your own from scratch.

## Tailor your approach for your users

The approach to guidance and induction is based on a real programme; you might find a different approach to this that works better for your use case.
