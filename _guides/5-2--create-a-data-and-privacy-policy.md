## Complying with data protection legislation

If you are in the UK, the UK Information Commissioner's Office publishes [guidance on data protection](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/) and [guidance on complying with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/) which you may find helpful.

The data protection activities you undertake, and [the documentation you are required to produce](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/documentation/), depends on the size of your organisation and the types of data you are collecting. 

The guidance from the ICO may not be everything you need to consider. Your organisation may have more rules and processes that you must follow when handling data or personal data.

You may have an in-house data protection team in your organisation that can help you to understand how to meet your obligations â€“ both internal to your organisation and for compliance with the law.

## Create a data and privacy policy

You should codify how you will collect, store and manage data as part of the programme, and publish this policy alongside the other documentation you give to participants. This is sometimes referred to as a 'privacy notice' or 'privacy policy'.

The content of the document will be heavily influenced by the requirements of local data laws and organisational policies. The Information Commissioner's Office provides a template and guidance on what to include

### Explain what you are doing with people's data

### Seek user agreement
