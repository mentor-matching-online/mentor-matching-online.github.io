You will need a way for participants in your programme to submit information about themselves, so that they can be matched. 

This section will provide recommendations for your registration process. It will provide guidance for the creation of registration forms and considerations you could make when collecting and processing data. 

We have also included template registration forms and an example data and privacy policy.

> There are many different ways to collect data from mentors and mentees participating in a mentoring programme. The guides, tools and resources on this website have been created to enable you to develop a large scale mentoring programme; one with with hundreds of participants. This focus on large scale programmes heavily influences the guidance in this section.
