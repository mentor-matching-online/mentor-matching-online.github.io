Once the time for [your chosen registration period]({% link _guides/7-2--open-registrations.md %}) has elapsed, close registrations for your programme.

Remember to:

1. turn off registration forms so they no longer accept new submissions
2. update any guidance documents or web pages that link to the forms to confirm that the registration window has ended
3. update any other communications materials to confirm that the registration window has ended
