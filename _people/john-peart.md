This [award winning](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/in-depth/article/watch-csw-chats-to-john-peart-about-a-civil-service-award-winning-lgbt-mentoring-scheme) programme matches junior LGBT+ staff to senior LGBT+ mentors.

Everything you see on this website is based on the learning from delivering that programme.
