The prospective participants in your programme will need to know:

- what your programme is and how it works
- what they would be expected to do as part of the programme
- how they can register to participate

You could include information like this in a general guidance document. You could signpost to this guidance when you are ready to [publicise your programme]({% link _guides/7-1--publicise-the-programme.md %}).

## What you could include

### Why your programme has been created

### How your programme works

### Who is eligible

### What is involved

### How to register

### Links to further information
