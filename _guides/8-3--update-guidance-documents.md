You are likely to receive questions about your programme from the moment that you start to publicise it, through to the end of your induction process. 

Once your induction sessions are complete, ensure that the [guidance documents you wrote earlier]({% link _guides/6-0--create-your-guidance-documents.md %}) are updated to:

- clarify any points of confusion
- add any additional information that was requested
- reflect any changes you have made to the programme as a result of feedback so far

> ## Case study
> ### Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme
> 
> During the induction sessions for the first round of the programme, mentees joining the programme requested additional materials and templates to help structure their engagements with their mentors. Some mentors also recommended some additional resources that could be used in sessions with mentees.
> 
> After the sessions were complete, new templates and additional resources were added to the guidance, and recirculated to all participants by email.
