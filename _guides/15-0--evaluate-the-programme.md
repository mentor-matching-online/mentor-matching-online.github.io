Now that your programme is complete, you could evaluate the final elements of the programme, or the programme as a whole.

You will have already [designed your programme evaluation]({% link _guides/3-0--design-your-programme-evaluation.md %}) and possibly [established a baseline to compare against]({% link _guides/10-0--evaluate-the-programme.md %}) and [surveyed participants after the initial intervention]({% link _guides/13-0--evaluate-the-programme.md %}).

If your evaluation design includes pre- and post- intervention evaluation methods, this is a good moment to establish whether the second intervention, or the whole intervention, as part of your programme has been effective[^parts]. 

[^parts]: If you are following the same format as our case study – a two-part programme, with speed mentoring followed by long-term mentoring – the "second intervention" is the long-term mentoring part of your programme. The "whole intervention" is the combination of speed mentoring and long-term mentoring.

The evaluation you do at this point can be compared against the baseline you have already established, and the earlier post-intervention survey, to see if your participants' awareness, skills or understanding has changed. 

The earlier guide on [creating pre- and post- intervention surveys]({% link _guides/3-2--create-pre-and-post-intervention-surveys.md %}) explains areas you could to evaluate.

You should use the final results and any analysis you undertake to inform future rounds of the programme. You may also want to publish a final evaluation report.
