If you have decided [what kind of programme you want to create]({% link _guides/2-2--decide-the-type-of-programme.md %}) and [who is eligible to take part]({% link _guides/2-3--decide-who-is-eligible.md %}), you can start to codify the criteria you will use during the matching process to pair each mentee and mentor. It is important to decide these rules upfront, because:

1. you will be able to set expectations for participants about what they can expect from the programme
2. if you intend to use [our matching software]({% link _guides/11-0--match-mentors-to-mentees.md %}), you will need to know they work in advance of inputting these rules into the system
