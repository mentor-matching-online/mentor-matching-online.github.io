excerpt: "What will you ask mentees and mentors to do as part of long-term mentoring?"
step: 14.1
order: 41

After you have provided sufficient time for speed mentoring – around 4 to 8 weeks – you should remind participants what they need to do next as part of the programme. 

You will have already decided how you want your long-term mentoring arrangements to work when you [designed your programme]({% link _guides/2-2--decide-the-type-of-programme.md %}) earlier.

This email will need to tell participants how they move from a speed mentoring interaction to a long-term interaction. 

Examples of the emails you could send are provided below.

> ## Case study
> ### Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme
> 
> For the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme, each mentee was matched with up to 3 mentors for speed mentoring. Mentees were given 4 weeks to hold their sessions. Mentees were told that they could either use this speed mentoring session to:
> 
> 1. get a one-off piece of guidance or advice from each mentor, or
> 2. explore whether each of their mentors were suitable matches for a longer-term mentoring arrangement
> 
> After the speed mentoring was complete, mentees were asked to select one of their speed mentors to approach as a long-term mentor. This long-term mentor then worked with their mentee for up to 12 months; meeting them for an hour every 4 to 8 weeks.
