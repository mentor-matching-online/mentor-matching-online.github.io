In addition to your [general guidance to all participants]({% link _guides/6-1--create-general-guidance.md %}), you may want to create additional guidance specifically for mentees on your programme. 

## What you could include

### What mentees are expected to do

### How the programme will work for mentees specifically

### Resources to support mentoring conversations

### Signposting to a code of conduct

You could signpost mentees to a [code of conduct]({% link _guides/6-4--create-a-code-of-conduct.md %}) that governs how they will be expected to behave and interact with their mentors on the programme.
