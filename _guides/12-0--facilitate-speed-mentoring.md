You should now have [matched your mentors and mentees]({% link _guides/11-2--use-the-software.md %}) and, if you have used our software, have two output files: â€“ `mentees-list.csv` and `mentors-list.csv`. You will use the data in these files to facilitate the first part of your mentoring programme: speed mentoring.

> The guides in this, and subsequent, sections assume that you are intending to facilitate speed mentoring first, and then facilitate a longer-term mentoring relationship.
> 
> If you've decided you only want to do one of these elements, follow the guides in the speed mentoring section first and then skip to [evaluating the programme]({% link _guides/15-0--evaluate-the-programme.md %}).

The guides in this section will help you to:

1. notify participants of their matches
2. guide participants through the speed mentoring stage
3. remind participants to act on their matches
